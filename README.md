========

DigiINETD is the [InterNET services Daemon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inetd). This is __interactive__ software that allowing for a __fine-grained__ control of who is allowed to access what or how many services at which time and log all that. This is lightweight [Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29) application that based on [C++ Boost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_%28C%2B%2B_libraries%29), [Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29), [AspectJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ)

DigiINETD is proprietary commercial software. You may bought this software for our best price as low as 0.00 in your country's local currency.

##### Key futures.

* bind services to a specific IP addresses
* interactive/__predefined__ access control
* start only enabled services
* log session __history__
* it is modular and easy to integrate with new components
* application component are multithreaded, asynchronous and event driven. Functional part of Scala nature allow to concentrate on primary target.
AOP with AspectJ weaving reduce redundant code.
* service component are rapid and __careful for battery life__. Bridge based on BOOST C++ library. This enables us to benefit from __epoll__.
* it is fully functional, has no ads and can be used for an unlimited period
